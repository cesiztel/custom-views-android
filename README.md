#Android Custom View Examples#

1. Compound Views 

    Android explanation about the concept of compound views:
    "If you don't want to create a completely customized component, but instead are looking to put together 
    a reusable component that consists of a group of existing controls, then creating a Compound Component 
    (or Compound Control) might fit the bill. In a nutshell, this brings together a number of more atomic 
    controls (or views) into a logical group of items that can be treated as a single thing."
